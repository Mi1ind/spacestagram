# Spacestagram

Spacestagram displays images from NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day API **built entirely using Shopify's Polaris Library for React**. I attempted to adhere to Shopify's Polaris design system for Spacestagram.

## Features
 - Makes API calls to NASA's API to display beautiful images of space.
 - Placeholder preview of content.
 - Share button copies image url to clipboard.
 - Like button with different states.
 - Swipe to refresh.
